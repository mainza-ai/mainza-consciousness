End-to-End Integration Tests for Throttling Response Flow (Isolated)
===================================================================

This test suite covers the complete flow from LLM request manager throttling 
to UI display, ensuring user-friendly messages appear instead of raw objects.
This version isolates the functions to avoid dependency issues.

Requirements covered: 1.2, 3.3, 3.4
