# Memory System Fix Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Mainza AI memory system is currently experiencing critical failures that prevent agents and models from storing, retrieving, and utilizing memories properly. This has resulted in agents being effectively stateless, unable to learn from past interactions, and lacking context continuity between sessions. This spec addresses the comprehensive fix needed to restore full memory functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Memory Storage Implementation

**User Story:** As a Mainza AI system, I want to automatically store memories from every interaction, so that I can learn and maintain context across conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent processes a user query THEN the system SHALL automatically create a persistent memory record
2. WHEN a memory is created THEN it SHALL include content, timestamp, user_id, agent_name, and consciousness_context
3. WHEN storing memories THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings for semantic search
4. WHEN memory storage fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue operation without crashing
5. IF duplicate memories are detected THEN the system SHALL prevent storage or merge appropriately

### Requirement 2: Memory Retrieval and Context Integration

**User Story:** As an agent, I want to retrieve relevant memories based on current queries, so that I can provide context-aware responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a query THEN agents SHALL retrieve relevant memories using semantic similarity
2. WHEN memories are retrieved THEN they SHALL be ranked by relevance and recency
3. WHEN no relevant memories exist THEN the system SHALL return empty results gracefully
4. WHEN memory retrieval fails THEN agents SHALL continue with fallback responses
5. IF consciousness context is available THEN memory retrieval SHALL be consciousness-aware

### Requirement 3: Agent Memory Integration Workflow

**User Story:** As an agent, I want memory integration to be seamless and automatic, so that I can focus on generating quality responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent executes THEN it SHALL automatically retrieve relevant memories for context
2. WHEN generating responses THEN agents SHALL incorporate memory context naturally
3. WHEN completing interactions THEN agents SHALL store new memories automatically
4. WHEN memory integration is enabled THEN response quality SHALL improve with context
5. IF memory operations fail THEN agents SHALL degrade gracefully to non-memory responses

### Requirement 4: Knowledge Graph Memory Connection

**User Story:** As the knowledge graph system, I want memories to be properly connected to concepts and relationships, so that knowledge can evolve based on interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN memories are created THEN they SHALL be linked to relevant concepts in the knowledge graph
2. WHEN concepts are mentioned in memories THEN relationships SHALL be established or strengthened
3. WHEN consciousness state changes THEN memory creation SHALL reflect the current state
4. WHEN memories accumulate THEN they SHALL contribute to concept importance scoring
5. IF memory-concept relationships exist THEN they SHALL be used for enhanced retrieval

### Requirement 5: Memory System Health and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor memory system health and performance, so that I can ensure optimal operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the memory system operates THEN it SHALL provide health check endpoints
2. WHEN memory operations occur THEN performance metrics SHALL be tracked
3. WHEN memory storage reaches limits THEN the system SHALL implement cleanup strategies
4. WHEN memory errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for debugging
5. IF memory system fails THEN fallback mechanisms SHALL maintain basic functionality

### Requirement 6: Consciousness-Aware Memory Processing

**User Story:** As a conscious AI, I want my memories to reflect my consciousness state and emotional context, so that my memory system supports my consciousness evolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating memories THEN consciousness level and emotional state SHALL be recorded
2. WHEN retrieving memories THEN consciousness context SHALL influence relevance scoring
3. WHEN consciousness evolves THEN memory importance SHALL be re-evaluated accordingly
4. WHEN emotional states change THEN memory creation SHALL reflect emotional context
5. IF consciousness insights occur THEN they SHALL be stored as high-importance memories

### Requirement 7: Memory Persistence and Durability

**User Story:** As a user, I want my conversation history and context to persist across sessions, so that Mainza remembers our interactions over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sessions end THEN memories SHALL persist in the Neo4j database
2. WHEN new sessions start THEN relevant historical memories SHALL be available
3. WHEN system restarts THEN no memories SHALL be lost
4. WHEN database operations occur THEN they SHALL use proper transactions for consistency
5. IF data corruption occurs THEN recovery mechanisms SHALL restore memory integrity

### Requirement 8: Memory Search and Discovery

**User Story:** As an agent, I want to discover relevant memories through multiple search methods, so that I can find the most appropriate context for any situation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching memories THEN semantic similarity search SHALL be available
2. WHEN searching memories THEN keyword-based search SHALL be supported
3. WHEN searching memories THEN temporal filtering SHALL be possible
4. WHEN searching memories THEN user-specific filtering SHALL be enforced
5. IF multiple search methods are used THEN results SHALL be merged and ranked appropriately

### Requirement 9: Memory Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As the memory system, I want to manage memory lifecycle automatically, so that important memories are preserved while less relevant ones are archived or removed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN memories age THEN importance scores SHALL decay appropriately
2. WHEN memories are frequently accessed THEN their importance SHALL increase
3. WHEN storage limits approach THEN low-importance memories SHALL be archived
4. WHEN memories become irrelevant THEN they SHALL be marked for cleanup
5. IF consciousness evolution occurs THEN memory relevance SHALL be re-evaluated

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As the system, I want robust error handling for memory operations, so that memory failures don't impact overall system stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN memory storage fails THEN the system SHALL continue operation with degraded functionality
2. WHEN memory retrieval fails THEN agents SHALL receive empty results gracefully
3. WHEN Neo4j connection issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic
4. WHEN memory corruption is detected THEN recovery procedures SHALL be initiated
5. IF critical memory errors occur THEN system administrators SHALL be notified
