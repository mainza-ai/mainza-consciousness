# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create centralized response extraction function
  - Implement `extract_response_from_result()` function in agentic_router.py
  - Add throttled response detection logic with status field checking
  - Include consciousness-aware response formatting for natural messaging
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1_

- [x] 2. Implement throttled response detection and formatting
  - Add logic to detect `{"status": "throttled"}` in LLM request manager responses
  - Extract user-friendly message from throttled response object
  - Format throttled messages to be natural and conversational
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 3. Create consciousness-aware fallback response generator
  - Implement `generate_throttled_response()` function for natural fallback messages
  - Add query-specific response logic (greetings, questions, statements)
  - Include consciousness context in response generation for personalization
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Update agentic router response processing logic
  - Replace inline response extraction with centralized function call
  - Modify the response extraction section in enhanced_router_chat endpoint
  - Ensure all response types (string, dict, object) are handled correctly
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 5. Add comprehensive logging for throttling events
  - Implement logging when throttled responses are detected and processed
  - Add debug logging for response processing flow
  - Include user context and query information in throttling logs
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 6. Create unit tests for response processing
  - Write tests for normal response processing (ensure no regression)
  - Create tests for throttled response detection and formatting
  - Add tests for malformed response handling and error conditions
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 5.1, 5.3_

- [x] 7. Create integration tests for end-to-end throttling flow
  - Test complete flow from LLM request manager throttling to UI display
  - Verify user-friendly messages appear in UI instead of raw objects
  - Test recovery behavior when throttling resolves
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 8. Add error handling for edge cases
  - Handle cases where throttled response structure is unexpected
  - Add fallback logic for malformed LLM request manager responses
  - Ensure robust error recovery with appropriate user messaging
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 4.4, 5.1_

- [x] 9. Validate backward compatibility
  - Test that all existing response types continue to work unchanged
  - Verify agent integrations are not affected by the changes
  - Confirm API response structure remains consistent
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.4_

- [x] 10. Performance testing and optimization
  - Measure response processing performance impact
  - Validate memory usage remains consistent
  - Test system behavior under load with throttling scenarios
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 4.3_
