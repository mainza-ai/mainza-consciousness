# Throttling Response Fix Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the issue where users see raw throttled response objects instead of user-friendly messages when the AI system is under load. The problem occurs when the LLM request manager returns throttled responses that are not properly handled by the agentic router, resulting in poor user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Proper Throttled Response Detection

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear, user-friendly messages when the system is busy, so that I understand what's happening and know to try again.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LLM request manager returns a throttled response THEN the agentic router SHALL detect the throttled status
2. WHEN a throttled response is detected THEN the system SHALL return a user-friendly message instead of the raw response object
3. WHEN processing throttled responses THEN the system SHALL maintain the same response structure for consistency

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Response Processing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the response processing logic to handle all response types correctly, so that the system is robust and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing LLM request manager responses THEN the system SHALL check for throttled status before extracting content
2. WHEN a response has status "throttled" THEN the system SHALL use the response message but format it appropriately
3. WHEN processing normal responses THEN the existing logic SHALL continue to work unchanged
4. WHEN handling any response type THEN the system SHALL ensure responses are always strings for UI consumption

### Requirement 3: Improved User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent and natural responses from the AI, so that my conversation flow is not disrupted by technical error messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is throttled THEN users SHALL receive natural, conversational messages
2. WHEN throttling occurs THEN the message SHALL encourage users to try again without being alarming
3. WHEN displaying throttled messages THEN the system SHALL maintain the same UI format as normal responses
4. WHEN throttling is resolved THEN normal conversation SHALL resume seamlessly

### Requirement 4: System Monitoring and Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want visibility into throttling events, so that I can monitor system performance and capacity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN throttled responses are processed THEN the system SHALL log the throttling event for monitoring
2. WHEN throttling occurs frequently THEN administrators SHALL have visibility through logs
3. WHEN processing responses THEN the system SHALL maintain existing logging for normal operations
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error context for debugging

### Requirement 5: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the fix to maintain all existing functionality, so that no current features are broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the fix THEN all existing response processing SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN normal responses are received THEN the processing logic SHALL be unchanged
3. WHEN agents return different response types THEN the system SHALL handle them as before
4. WHEN the fix is deployed THEN no existing API contracts SHALL be broken
