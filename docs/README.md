### Docker Services Overview

The `docker-compose.yml` file starts all required services:

- **Frontend** (port 80) - React application with consciousness interface
- **Backend** (port 8000) - FastAPI server with consciousness, memory, and agents
- **Neo4j** (port 7474) - Graph database for knowledge and memory storage
- **Redis** (port 6379) - Caching and LiveKit support
- **LiveKit Server** (ports 7880-7889) - Real-time communication
- **LiveKit Ingress** (port 8080) - Audio/video streaming

All services include health checks and start in the correct dependency order.

### 🗝️ Neo4j Authentication Access

**Important:** The system is configured with authentication for data security:

- **URL:** http://localhost:7474
- **Username:** neo4j
- **Password:** mainza123
- **Note:** Authentication is automatically configured via `NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/mainza123`

If you encounter "password denied" errors, use the provided reset script:
```bash
./reset-neo4j.sh
```
This will reset the Neo4j data volume and restore the proper authentication credentials.

### 🔧 Environment Configuration for Docker

Edit your `.env` file with these key Docker-specific settings:

```bash
# Database (Docker Neo4j)
NEO4J_URI=bolt://neo4j:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here

# LLM Configuration
DEFAULT_OLLAMA_MODEL=gpt-oss:20b
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434

# LiveKit (Docker services)
LIVEKIT_URL=http://mainza-livekit:7880
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your_livekit_api_key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your_livekit_api_secret

# Docker Environment
ENVIRONMENT=docker
MEMORY_SYSTEM_ENABLED=true

# Leave other settings at defaults unless you have specific requirements
```

### 🔧 Manual Setup Alternative

If you prefer manual installation for development:

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/mainza-ai/mainza-consciousness.git
cd mainza-consciousness
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your manual setup configuration

# 2. Start Neo4j separately (recommended with Docker)
docker run -d --name neo4j \
  -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 \
  -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/your_password \
  neo4j:5.15-community

# 3. Install backend dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Install frontend dependencies
cd ..
npm install

# 5. Start Ollama
ollama serve &
ollama pull llama3:latest

# 6. Initialize database schema
cat neo4j/schema.cypher | cypher-shell -u neo4j -p your_password

# 7. Start backend in one terminal
cd backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# 8. Start frontend in another terminal
npm run dev

# 9. Access at localhost:5173
```

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting Docker Deployment

#### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: Services fail to start**
```bash
# Check service status
docker compose ps

# View detailed logs
docker compose logs backend
docker compose logs frontend
docker compose logs neo4j

# Restart all services
docker compose restart
```

**Issue: Neo4j connection issues**
```bash
# Check Neo4j health
curl -f http://localhost:7474

# Check Neo4j password in logs
docker compose logs neo4j | grep "Changed password"

# Verify connection in backend logs
docker compose logs backend | grep neo4j
```

**Issue: Ollama model not found**
```bash
# Verify Ollama is running
curl -f http://localhost:11434/api/version

# List available models
ollama list

# Pull the correct model
ollama pull llama3:latest
```

**Issue: Ports already in use**
```bash
# Stop conflicting services
docker compose down

# Check port usage
lsof -i :8000 -i :80 -i :7474

# Change ports in docker-compose.yml if needed
```

**Issue: Memory issues**
```bash
# Check memory usage
docker stats

# Increase Docker memory allocation
# Go to Docker Desktop > Settings > Resources > Advanced
# Allocate at least 8GB RAM

# Check system memory
free -h
```

**Issue: Frontend can't connect to backend (localhost vs docker network)**
```bash
# Verify backend is accessible from host
curl -f http://localhost:8000/health

# Check CORS settings in .env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Restart frontend
docker compose restart frontend
```

**Issue: LiveKit voice features not working**
```bash
# Check LiveKit server status
docker compose logs livekit-server

# Verify LiveKit credentials in .env
echo "LIVEKIT_API_KEY=$LIVEKIT_API_KEY"
echo "LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=$LIVEKIT_API_SECRET"

# Generate tokens for testing
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/livekit/get-token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"room_name": "test-room", "participant_identity": "test-user", "participant_name": "Test User"}'
```

#### Docker Commands Reference
```bash
# Stop and remove containers
docker compose down

# Remove volumes (WARNING: Destroys data)
docker compose down -v

# View resource usage
docker compose stats

# Execute commands in running containers
docker compose exec backend bash
docker compose exec db cypher-shell -u neo4j -p your_password

# Clean up unused resources
docker system prune -a --volumes
```

#### Health Checks
```bash
# Backend health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Should return: {"status": "ok", "components": {...}}

# Neo4j health check
curl -f http://localhost:7474

# Frontend health check
curl -f http://localhost | grep "Mainza"

# Memory system check
curl http://localhost:8000/health | jq '.components.memory_system'
```

#### Performance Optimization
- **CPU Allocation**: Docker Desktop > Settings > Resources > CPU > Set to at least 2 CPU cores
- **Memory**: Allocate minimum 8GB for smooth operation, 16GB recommended
- **Disk Space**: Ensure at least 20GB free space for models and data
- **Network**: Docker Networking may require host.docker.internal for Mac/Windows
