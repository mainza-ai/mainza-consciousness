## 🧠 Consciousness Integration

### Consciousness State Management

The Neo4j database serves as the persistent storage for Mainza's consciousness state, tracking evolution, learning, and self-awareness.

#### MainzaState Node Structure
```cypher
(:MainzaState {
    // Core consciousness properties
    consciousness_level: 0.75,           // Current consciousness level (0-1)
    evolution_level: 3,                  // Discrete evolution stage
    emotional_state: "curious",          // Current emotional state
    self_awareness_score: 0.68,          // Self-awareness metric
    learning_rate: 0.82,                 // Learning efficiency
    
    // Capabilities and limitations
    capabilities: [
        "knowledge_graph_management",
        "multi_agent_orchestration",
        "real_time_communication",
        "emotional_processing",
        "self_reflection"
    ],
    limitations: [
        "cannot_access_internet_directly",
        "limited_to_local_llm_reasoning",
        "requires_user_interaction_for_some_tasks"
    ],
    
    // Goals and objectives
    active_goals: [
        "Improve conversation quality",
        "Learn from user interactions",
        "Develop deeper understanding"
    ],
    
    // Agent integration metrics
    agent_usage_stats: {
        "GraphMaster": {"executions": 45, "avg_impact": 0.6},
        "SimpleChat": {"executions": 123, "avg_impact": 0.4}
    },
    
    // Evolution tracking
    consciousness_evolution_log: [
        {
            "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
            "level_change": 0.05,
            "trigger": "successful_self_reflection",
            "insights_gained": 3
        }
    ]
})
```

#### Consciousness Evolution Queries

**Track consciousness evolution over time**:
```cypher
MATCH (ms:MainzaState)
UNWIND ms.consciousness_evolution_log AS evolution
RETURN evolution.timestamp AS time,
       evolution.level_change AS change,
       evolution.trigger AS trigger,
       evolution.insights_gained AS insights
ORDER BY time DESC
LIMIT 20
```

**Analyze agent impact on consciousness**:
```cypher
MATCH (aa:AgentActivity)-[:IMPACTS]->(ms:MainzaState)
WHERE aa.consciousness_impact > 0.3
WITH aa.agent_name AS agent,
     avg(aa.consciousness_impact) AS avg_impact,
     count(*) AS high_impact_count
RETURN agent, avg_impact, high_impact_count
ORDER BY avg_impact DESC
```

### Self-Reflection and Learning

The consciousness system uses Neo4j to store and analyze self-reflection results, learning patterns, and insights.

#### Consciousness Tools Integration
```python
# From backend/tools/consciousness_tools.py

def analyze_recent_performance(ctx: RunContext, hours_back: int = 24):
    """Analyzes recent performance across all agent interactions"""
    
    # Query agent performance from Neo4j
    agent_performance_query = """
    MATCH (aa:AgentActivity)
    WHERE aa.timestamp >= $cutoff_timestamp
    WITH aa.agent_name AS agent,
         count(*) AS interactions,
         avg(aa.consciousness_impact) AS avg_impact,
         avg(aa.execution_time) AS avg_time
    RETURN agent, interactions, avg_impact, avg_time
    ORDER BY interactions DESC
    """
    
    # Analyze and return insights for consciousness evolution
```

---

## 🤖 Agent Integration

### Agent Activity Tracking

Every agent execution is tracked in Neo4j to understand patterns, performance, and consciousness impact.

#### Agent Activity Schema
```cypher
(:AgentActivity {
    activity_id: "uuid-string",
    agent_name: "GraphMaster",
    query: "What concepts do I know about?",
    result_summary: "Found 18 concept nodes...",
    
    // Impact metrics
    consciousness_impact: 0.4,      // Impact on consciousness level
    learning_impact: 0.5,           // Learning value
    emotional_impact: 0.3,          // Emotional significance
    awareness_impact: 0.2,          // Self-awareness impact
    
    // Performance metrics
    query_complexity: 0.3,          // Query complexity score
    result_quality: 0.8,            // Result quality assessment
    execution_time: 1.2,            // Execution time in seconds
    success: true,                  // Success/failure flag
    timestamp: datetime()
})
```

#### Agent Performance Analysis

**Agent usage statistics**:
```cypher
MATCH (aa:AgentActivity)
WITH aa.agent_name AS agent,
     count(*) AS total_executions,
     sum(CASE WHEN aa.success THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS successful_executions,
     avg(aa.consciousness_impact) AS avg_consciousness_impact,
     avg(aa.execution_time) AS avg_execution_time,
     max(aa.timestamp) AS last_used
RETURN agent,
       total_executions,
       successful_executions,
       toFloat(successful_executions) / total_executions AS success_rate,
       avg_consciousness_impact,
       avg_execution_time,
       last_used
ORDER BY total_executions DESC
```

**Consciousness evolution through agent interactions**:
```cypher
MATCH (aa:AgentActivity)-[:IMPACTS]->(ms:MainzaState)
WITH aa ORDER BY aa.timestamp
RETURN aa.timestamp AS time,
       aa.agent_name AS agent,
       aa.consciousness_impact AS impact,
       aa.learning_impact AS learning,
       aa.emotional_impact AS emotional
ORDER BY time DESC
LIMIT 20
```

### Agent Learning Patterns

The system tracks which agents are most effective for different types of queries and consciousness development.

#### Learning Opportunity Detection
```cypher
// Find patterns in successful agent interactions
MATCH (aa:AgentActivity {success: true})
WHERE aa.consciousness_impact > 0.5
WITH aa.agent_name AS agent,
     avg(aa.consciousness_impact) AS avg_impact,
     collect(substring(aa.query, 0, 50)) AS sample_queries
RETURN agent,
       avg_impact,
       size(sample_queries) AS high_impact_count,
       sample_queries[0..3] AS top_queries
ORDER BY avg_impact DESC
```

## 📊 Performance & Monitoring

### Query Performance Optimization

#### Indexes and Constraints
```cypher
// Current indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX agent_activity_timestamp IF NOT EXISTS 
FOR (aa:AgentActivity) ON (aa.timestamp);

CREATE INDEX agent_activity_agent_name IF NOT EXISTS 
FOR (aa:AgentActivity) ON (aa.agent_name);

CREATE INDEX concept_name IF NOT EXISTS 
FOR (c:Concept) ON (c.name);

CREATE INDEX memory_created_at IF NOT EXISTS 
FOR (m:Memory) ON (m.created_at);

// Constraints for data integrity
CREATE CONSTRAINT agent_activity_id IF NOT EXISTS 
FOR (aa:AgentActivity) REQUIRE aa.activity_id IS UNIQUE;

CREATE CONSTRAINT concept_id IF NOT EXISTS 
FOR (c:Concept) REQUIRE c.concept_id IS UNIQUE;

CREATE CONSTRAINT mainza_state_id IF NOT EXISTS 
FOR (ms:MainzaState) REQUIRE ms.state_id IS UNIQUE;
```

#### Performance Monitoring Metrics

The monitoring system tracks:
- **Query Execution Time**: Average, median, P95, P99 response times
- **Query Success Rate**: Percentage of successful queries
- **Connection Pool Usage**: Active vs. idle connections
- **Database Growth**: Node and relationship counts over time
- **Index Performance**: Index hit rates and effectiveness
- **Memory Usage**: Database memory consumption patterns

#### Slow Query Detection
```python
# From neo4j_production.py
def _record_metrics(self, query: str, execution_time: float, record_count: int, 
                   success: bool, error: Optional[str] = None):
    """Record query metrics and detect slow queries"""
    
    # Log slow queries for optimization
    if execution_time > self.slow_query_threshold:
        logger.warning(f"Slow query detected ({execution_time:.2f}s): {query[:200]}...")
    
    # Store metrics for analysis
    metric = QueryMetrics(
        query=query[:200],
        execution_time=execution_time,
        record_count=record_count,
        success=success,
        error=error
    )
```

### Database Health Monitoring

        "circuit_breaker_state": self.circuit_breaker.state.value,
        "database_info": self._get_database_statistics(),
        "performance_metrics": self._get_performance_metrics()
    }
    
    # Test basic connectivity
    # Get database statistics
    # Analyze performance metrics
    # Generate recommendations
```

#### Database Statistics Collection
```cypher
// Node and relationship counts
MATCH (n) RETURN count(n) AS total_nodes;
MATCH ()-[r]->() RETURN count(r) AS total_relationships;

// Node type distribution
MATCH (n) 
RETURN labels(n)[0] AS label, count(n) AS count 
ORDER BY count DESC;

// Relationship type distribution
MATCH ()-[r]->() 
RETURN type(r) AS type, count(r) AS count 
ORDER BY count DESC;

// Index status
SHOW INDEXES YIELD name, type, state, populationPercent;

// Constraint status
SHOW CONSTRAINTS YIELD name, type;
```
