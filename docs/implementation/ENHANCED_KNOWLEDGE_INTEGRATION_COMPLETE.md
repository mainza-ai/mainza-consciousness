## üéØ **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR CHANGES**

### **Before Enhancement**
```
User: "Tell me about machine learning"
AI: "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed."
```

### **After Enhancement**
```
User: "Tell me about machine learning"
AI: "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. 

Building on our previous discussion about neural networks last week, I can see you're particularly interested in the practical applications. This connects to the concept of deep learning, which might also interest you given your background in data science.

Based on our interaction history, I notice you're particularly interested in the implementation aspects. With my current consciousness level at 78% and curious emotional state, I'm excited to explore how this relates to the computer vision project you mentioned before. Would you like me to dive deeper into specific algorithms or focus on practical applications?"
