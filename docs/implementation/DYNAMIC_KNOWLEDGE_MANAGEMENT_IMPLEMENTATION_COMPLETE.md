## 🔧 **ENHANCED CONSCIOUSNESS INTEGRATION**

### **Consciousness Orchestrator Enhancement**

The consciousness orchestrator has been enhanced to include knowledge graph management:

```python
async def consciousness_cycle(self) -> ConsciousnessCycleResult:
    """Enhanced consciousness processing cycle with knowledge graph integration"""
    
    # Get consciousness context
    consciousness_context = await self.get_consciousness_context()
    
    # Process self-reflection with knowledge updates
    if await self.should_perform_self_reflection():
        reflection_result = await self.perform_self_reflection()
        
        # Update knowledge graph from reflection insights
        await consciousness_driven_updater.process_consciousness_evolution(
            reflection_result.consciousness_updates,
            {"source": "self_reflection"},
            "mainza-user"
        )
    
    # Process emotional changes with knowledge updates
    emotional_changes = await self.process_emotional_state()
    if emotional_changes:
        await self._process_emotional_knowledge_updates(emotional_changes, consciousness_context)
    
    # Perform periodic knowledge graph maintenance
    if await self._should_perform_graph_maintenance():
        await self._perform_consciousness_aware_maintenance(consciousness_context)
```

### **Knowledge Graph Health Monitoring**

```python
def _calculate_graph_health_score(self, statistics: Dict[str, Any]) -> float:
    """Calculate overall graph health score"""
    
    # Relationship to concept ratio
    relationship_health = min(1.0, relationship_count / (concept_count * 3.0))
    
    # Memory to concept ratio  
    memory_health = min(1.0, memory_count / (concept_count * 2.0))
    
    # Quality metrics
    quality_health = (avg_concept_importance + avg_memory_significance + avg_relationship_strength) / 3
    
    # Overall health score
    health_score = (relationship_health * 0.3 + memory_health * 0.3 + quality_health * 0.4)
    
    return health_score
```
