# Mainza Consciousness: Codebase Analysis

**ðŸŽ‰ PRODUCTION READY** - All critical fixes implemented and validated âœ…

This document provides a comprehensive, up-to-date breakdown of the Mainza Consciousness application, reflecting a deep dive into every backend and frontend file as of the current implementation, including the completed critical fixes implementation (July 17, 2025).

## 1. Overall Architecture

Mainza Consciousness is a next-generation, agentic AI system designed for cognitive symbiosis. It is built on a modular, decoupled architecture:

- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI) with a robust agentic framework (pydantic-ai/Context7), Neo4j for the "Living Memory," and Ollama as the default LLM provider (cloud LLMs optional, plumbing present but disabled by default).
- **Frontend:** React (Vite + TypeScript) with a highly interactive, animated UI that visualizes Mainza's state, memory, and proactive needs.
- **Voice/Real-Time:** LiveKit for low-latency audio streaming, XTTS for TTS, Whisper for STT.

## 2. Backend Deep Dive (`backend/`)

### Core Files
- **main.py:** Initializes FastAPI, Neo4j, and ML models. Exposes CRUD endpoints for all graph node types (User, Conversation, Memory, Document, etc.), as well as agentic and voice endpoints. Implements PRD features like Tamagotchi System and Recommendation Engine.
- **agentic_router.py:** Central API hub for agentic endpoints. Each agent (GraphMaster, TaskMaster, CodeWeaver, RAG, Notification, Calendar, Conductor, Router, Research) is exposed via a dedicated endpoint, calling `.run()` on the agent. Integrates with LiveKit for voice.
- **agentic_config.py:** Configures Ollama (local LLM) and, if enabled, cloud LLMs (OpenAI). All agents use these models via pydantic-ai's OpenAIProvider. Cloud LLM federation is present but disabled by default.

### Agentic Framework (`agents/`, `tools/`, `models/`)
- **Agents:** Each agent (router, conductor, graphmaster, taskmaster, codeweaver, rag, notification, calendar, research, cloud) is a pydantic-ai Agent, defined with a system prompt, toolset, and output models. All agents are Ollama-native by default, with cloud fallback if enabled. Research and Cloud agents are only instantiated if cloud LLM is enabled.
- **Tools:** Each agent has a corresponding tools file (e.g., `graphmaster_tools.py`, `taskmaster_tools.py`, `research_tools.py`) implementing all tool functions with `ctx: RunContext` as the first parameter, per pydantic-ai/Context7 standards. Tools interact with Neo4j, the file system, or external APIs as needed. The Cloud agent is tool-less.
- **Models:** All agent I/O is strictly typed with Pydantic models (e.g., `Task`, `TaskList`, `GraphQueryOutput`, `RAGOutput`, `ResearchResult`). Models are defined in `models/` and used for both agent output and API validation. All tools return Pydantic models, never dicts. The Cloud agent returns a string, which is context7-compliant for its use case.
- **Utilities:** Embedding, validation, and Neo4j connection logic are in `utils/`.

#### Agent Inventory (with tools and models)
- **GraphMaster**: Tools: cypher_query, run_cypher, find_related_concepts, get_user_conversations, get_entity_mentions, get_open_tasks_for_user, chunk_document, analyze_knowledge_gaps, summarize_conversation, find_unresolved_entities, suggest_next_steps, get_document_usage, get_concept_graph, get_entity_graph, summarize_recent_conversations, create_memory. Models: GraphQueryOutput, SummarizeRecentConversationsOutput, CreateMemoryOutput.
- **TaskMaster**: Tools: create_task, get_task_by_id, update_task_status, list_open_tasks. Models: Task, TaskList.
- **CodeWeaver**: Tools: run_python_code, read_file, write_file, list_files, delete_file, run_shell_command, move_file, copy_file, file_info. Models: CodeWeaverOutput.
- **RAG**: Tools: retrieve_relevant_chunks, retrieve_chunks_by_entity, retrieve_chunks_by_concept, retrieve_chunks_by_tag, retrieve_chunks_by_date. Models: RAGOutput.
- **Notification**: Tools: send_notification, list_notifications. Models: NotificationOutput.
- **Calendar**: Tools: create_event, list_events, delete_event. Models: CalendarOutput.
- **Conductor**: Tools: run_graphmaster_query, run_taskmaster_command, run_rag_query. Models: ConductorResult, ConductorFailure, ConductorState.
- **Router**: Tools: route_to_graphmaster, route_to_taskmaster, route_to_codeweaver, route_to_rag, route_to_conductor, (optionally route_to_cloud_llm). Models: RouterFailure, CloudLLMFailure.
- **Research** (only if cloud LLM enabled): Tools: search_the_web. Models: ResearchResult. Only instantiated if cloud LLM is enabled.
- **Cloud** (only if cloud LLM enabled): Tools: None (tool-less). Models: str (returns a string). Only instantiated if cloud LLM is enabled.

### Key Agentic Flows
- **Router Agent:** Receives user input, routes to the correct specialist agent/tool (local or cloud LLM, GraphMaster, TaskMaster, etc.). If cloud LLM is enabled, can route to Research or Cloud agents.
- **Conductor Agent:** Orchestrates multi-step workflows, calling other agents/tools in sequence or parallel. (Note: The Conductor agent is implemented and functional, but complex multi-agent orchestration is still evolving.)
- **GraphMaster Agent:** Sole guardian of Neo4j, implements all graph queries, memory creation, RAG chunking, and recommendation logic.
- **TaskMaster Agent:** Manages tasks, reminders, and links to concepts/entities in the graph.
- **CodeWeaver Agent:** Executes code, manages file system/terminal access (sandboxed), and supports self-correction loops.
- **RAG Agent:** Retrieves relevant document/context chunks from Neo4j for LLM-augmented answers.
- **Notification/Calendar/Research Agents:** Handle reminders, events, and web research (cloud LLM required for research). Research and Cloud agents are only available if cloud LLM is enabled.
- **Cloud Agent:** Only initialized if cloud LLM is enabled; otherwise, is None. Tool-less, returns a string.

### Compliance & Best Practices
- All tool functions use `

## Proactive Learning & Mainza Consciousness Loop

Mainza runs a background proactive learning loop on startup. This loop:
- Analyzes knowledge gaps in the Neo4j graph (via GraphMaster tools)
- Uses the ResearchAgent to proactively research concepts Mainza "needs to learn"
- Stores new knowledge as a Memory in the graph
- Notifies the frontend via LiveKit with a proactive summary
- Can be triggered/tested via the `/dev/create_test_need` endpoint

**Key files:** `background/mainza_consciousness.py`, `main.py`

## Full CRUD & Relationship Endpoints

The backend exposes full CRUD endpoints for all graph node types and relationships:
- **User:** `/users` (POST, GET)
- **Conversation:** `/conversations` (POST, GET)
- **Memory:** `/memories` (POST, GET), `/memories/discussed_in` (link)
- **Document:** `/documents` (POST, GET)
- **Chunk:** `/chunks` (POST, GET), `/chunks/derived_from` (link)
- **Entity:** `/entities` (POST, GET)
- **Concept:** `/concepts` (POST, GET)
- **MainzaState:** `/mainzastates` (POST, GET)
- **Relationships:**
  - `DISCUSSED_IN` (Memory <-> Conversation, User <-> Memory)
  - `DERIVED_FROM` (Chunk <-> Document)
  - `MENTIONS` (Conversation <-> Document/Entity)
  - `RELATES_TO` (generic, any node types)
  - `NEEDS_TO_LEARN` (MainzaState <-> Concept)
- **Advanced queries:**
  - `/concepts/related` (find related concepts)
  - `/users/conversation_history` (get conversation history)
  - `/conversations/memories` (get memories in conversation)
  - `/conversations/documents` (get documents mentioned in conversation)

All endpoints use strict Pydantic models for request/response.

## Tamagotchi/Sentience Analyzer

- **/mainza/analyze_needs:** Analyzes the knowledge graph for knowledge gaps, skill underutilization, and curiosity synthesis. Updates MainzaState's `current_needs` property. Drives the Tamagotchi system and proactive learning.

---

## Recommendations Engine

- **/recommendations/next_steps:** Returns recommendations for the user (currently stubbed, designed for future expansion).

---

## Chat/Memory Creation Endpoint

- **/chat/message:** Accepts a chat message, creates a Memory, links it to User and Conversation, and returns a response. Integrates chat with the knowledge graph.

---

## LiveKit Token & Audio Endpoints

- **/livekit/get-token:** Issues a LiveKit JWT for real-time audio/video
- **/tts/livekit:** Streams synthesized TTS to LiveKit

---

## Dev/Test Endpoints

- **/dev/create_test_need:** Creates a test scenario for proactive learning (ensures MainzaState and a test Concept exist and are linked)

---

## Pydantic Models for All Graph Types

All node and relationship types have strict Pydantic models, including:
- User, Conversation, Memory, Document, Chunk, Entity, Concept, MainzaState
- MemoryToConversationLink, ChunkToDocumentLink, ConversationMentionsDocumentOrEntity, RelatesToLink, MainzaNeedsToLearnLink, RelatedConceptsRequest, ConversationHistoryRequest, MemoriesInConversationRequest, DocumentsMentionedRequest, etc.

---

## Error Handling & Logging

All endpoints have robust error handling and logging:
- All errors return clear JSON with tracebacks
- Logging is enabled for all major flows, including TTS/STT, proactive learning, and graph operations
- Temp files are cleaned up after use
