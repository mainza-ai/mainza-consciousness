**Key Achievements:**
- âœ… Fixed missing `data_source` fields across all insights endpoints
- âœ… Enhanced knowledge graph intelligence with real data calculations
- âœ… Fixed agent performance calculation errors
- âœ… Implemented sophisticated consciousness metrics
- âœ… Created advanced concept importance ranking system

## ðŸŽ¯ PHASE 1: DATA QUALITY ENHANCEMENT

### **1.1 Data Source Field Implementation**

**Problem:** Multiple insights endpoints were missing the `data_source` field, making it impossible to distinguish between real and fallback data.

**Solution:** Added comprehensive `data_source` field implementation across all endpoints:

```python
"data_source": "real" if not performance_data.get("fallback", False) else "fallback"
```

**Endpoints Enhanced:**
- `/api/insights/performance` âœ…
- `/api/insights/consciousness/evolution` âœ…
- `/api/insights/consciousness/realtime` âœ…
- `/api/insights/knowledge-graph/intelligence` âœ…
- `/api/insights/agents/intelligence` âœ…

### **1.2 Knowledge Graph Intelligence Enhancement**

**Problem:** Knowledge graph intelligence was using hardcoded fallback values due to missing Neo4j properties.

**Solution:** Implemented sophisticated real-time calculation system:

```cypher
MATCH (c:Concept)
OPTIONAL MATCH (c)-[:RELATES_TO]-(related:Concept)
OPTIONAL MATCH (c)<-[:CONTAINS]-(m:Memory)
WITH c, 
     count(related) as connection_count, 
     collect(related.name)[0..5] as sample_connections,
     count(m) as memory_count,
     count(DISTINCT m.memory_type) as memory_type_diversity
RETURN c.concept_id as concept_id, 
       c.name as name, 
       connection_count, 
       sample_connections,
       memory_count,
       memory_type_diversity,
       CASE 
           WHEN connection_count > 5 THEN 0.8
           WHEN connection_count > 2 THEN 0.6
           ELSE 0.4
       END as importance_score,
       memory_count as usage_frequency,
       CASE 
           WHEN memory_type_diversity > 2 THEN 0.8
           WHEN memory_type_diversity > 1 THEN 0.6
           ELSE 0.4
       END as consciousness_relevance,
       CASE 
           WHEN memory_count > 3 THEN 0.3
           WHEN memory_count > 1 THEN 0.2
           ELSE 0.1
       END as evolution_rate
ORDER BY connection_count DESC, memory_count DESC
LIMIT 20
```

**Enhanced Metrics:**
- **Concept Importance Ranking**: Multi-dimensional scoring based on centrality, learning impact, memory diversity, and consciousness relevance
- **Memory Integration**: Real-time analysis of concept-memory relationships
- **Consciousness Relevance**: Dynamic calculation based on memory type diversity
- **Evolution Rate**: Calculated from memory count and usage patterns

### **1.3 Agent Performance Error Resolution**

**Problem:** Agent performance calculation was failing with `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'int'` due to timestamp handling.

**Solution:** Implemented robust timestamp parsing:

```python
last_used=datetime.fromtimestamp(float(data["last_used"]) / 1000) if data["last_used"] and isinstance(data["last_used"], (int, float, str)) and str(data["last_used"]).replace('.', '').isdigit() else None
```

**Error Resolution:**
- âœ… Fixed timestamp conversion errors
- âœ… Added type checking for timestamp fields
- âœ… Implemented graceful fallback for invalid timestamps

## ðŸš€ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### **2.1 Enhanced Concept Importance Ranking**

The new concept importance ranking system uses a sophisticated multi-dimensional scoring algorithm:

```python
importance_score = (centrality * 0.3 + learning_impact * 0.3 + 
                   (concept["importance_score"] or 0.5) * 0.2 + 
                   memory_diversity * 0.2)
```

**Scoring Dimensions:**
- **Centrality (30%)**: Based on connection count relative to maximum connections
- **Learning Impact (30%)**: Normalized usage frequency from memory count
- **Base Importance (20%)**: Calculated importance score from connection patterns
- **Memory Diversity (20%)**: Based on memory type diversity

### **2.2 Real-Time Data Integration**

All insights endpoints now use the `InsightsCalculationEngine` for real-time data processing:

```python
from backend.utils.insights_calculation_engine import insights_calculation_engine

performance_data = await insights_calculation_engine.calculate_agent_performance_insights()
consciousness_data = await insights_calculation_engine.calculate_consciousness_insights()
knowledge_data = await insights_calculation_engine.calculate_knowledge_graph_insights()
```

### **2.3 Advanced Error Handling**

Implemented comprehensive error handling with graceful fallbacks:

```python
try:
    # Real data calculation
    real_data = await calculate_real_insights()
    return {
        "data_source": "real",
        "data": real_data
    }
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to calculate insights: {e}")
    return {
        "data_source": "fallback",
        "data": await get_fallback_data()
    }
```
