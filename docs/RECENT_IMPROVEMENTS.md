## üîß **Enhanced Model Selection** (Phase 10)

### What It Is
Seamless integration with Ollama for flexible AI model usage, allowing users to switch between different models while maintaining conversation context.

### Key Features
- **Ollama Integration**: Seamless switching between available models
- **Conversation Persistence**: Maintains chat history across model changes
- **Real-Time Model Detection**: Automatic discovery of available Ollama models
- **Error-Free Operation**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: `ModelSelector` component with real-time model detection
- **Backend**: Enhanced LLM execution with dynamic model switching
- **Persistence**: LocalStorage for conversation and model persistence
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### User Experience
- Model selector in the left panel above the needs system
- Real-time model detection and switching
- Conversation persistence across model changes
- Clear error messages and fallback options

## üõ†Ô∏è **System Stability & Performance**

### Neo4j Access Mode Fix
**Problem**: Neo4j connections were defaulting to read-only mode, preventing write operations like creating needs and recording interactions.

**Solution**: Implemented automatic access mode detection in the Neo4j production manager:
- Auto-detects write operations by scanning for keywords (`CREATE`, `MERGE`, `SET`, `DELETE`, etc.)
- Dynamically switches between `READ` and `WRITE` modes
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing code

### API Error Resolution
**Problem**: Multiple 500 Internal Server Errors due to incorrect parameter passing and async/await issues.

**Solution**: Comprehensive fixes across the needs system:
- Fixed Neo4j query parameter format (dictionary instead of keyword arguments)
- Removed incorrect `await` keywords from non-async methods
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### UI/UX Improvements
**Problem**: Poor contrast, positioning issues, and inconsistent evolution level display.

**Solution**: Systematic UI/UX enhancements:
- Enhanced contrast throughout the insights page
- Improved positioning and layout stability
- Synchronized evolution level display across components
- Smooth animations and transitions

### Backend Optimization
**Problem**: Performance issues and query errors in the insights calculation system.

**Solution**: Comprehensive backend improvements:
- Created `InsightsCalculationEngine` for centralized calculations
- Added robust type conversions and null checks
- Implemented division-by-zero protection
- Enhanced query performance and error handling
