# Frontend â‡„ Backend Integration Report (Verified)

Date: 2025-09-23

## Scope
- Verified live API routes with curl against `http://localhost:8000`.
- Read backend routers and main application mounts.
- Scanned frontend entry points, pages, and components for API usage.

## Confirmed Backend Routers and Mounts
- backend/main.py mounts:
  - agentic_router (root)
  - insights_router at /api/insights
  - websocket_insights_router at /api
  - predictive_analytics_router at /api
  - memory_system_router (root)
  - needs_router at /api
  - build_info_router (root)
  - telemetry_router (root)

## Endpoints Returning 200 (live)
- /health
- /consciousness/state
- /consciousness/insights
- /concepts
- /memories
- /telemetry/status
- /telemetry/summary
- /performance
- Feature endpoints in backend/main.py:
  - Quantum: /quantum/processors, /quantum/jobs, /quantum/statistics (GET); /quantum/process (POST)
  - 3D: /consciousness/3d/nodes, /consciousness/3d/connections
  - AI Models: /ai-models, /ai-models/training
  - BCI: /bci/neural-signals, /bci/brain-states
  - Web3: /web3/identities, /web3/daos, /web3/protocols
  - Marketplace: /marketplace/services
- Insights (mounted): /api/insights/* routes used by InsightsPage.tsx resolve (200).

## Frontend Usage Map
- src/pages/InsightsPage.tsx
  - Uses /api/insights/... routes (overview, neo4j statistics, relationships, consciousness evolution, performance, etc.)
- src/pages/Index.tsx
  - Uses /consciousness/state, /consciousness/insights, agent chat, STT/TTS, recommendations endpoints
- src/components/Consciousness3DVisualization.tsx
  - Fetches /consciousness/3d/nodes, /consciousness/3d/connections

## Fixes Implemented
- src/components/Consciousness3DVisualization.tsx
  - Removed placeholder sample nodes; starts from provided or fetched data only
  - Replaced random IDs with deterministic stableId generation
  - Added missing Heart icon import; fixed icon rendering for emotion type

## Gaps/Follow-ups
- Ensure components avoid GET on POST-only routes (e.g., /quantum/process should POST)
- Continue removing any fallback/mock logic if encountered during use
- Consider adding CI curl probes for the critical routes to prevent drift

## CI Probe Suggestions (example)
```bash
curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/health
curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/consciousness/state
curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/api/insights/overview
curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/consciousness/3d/nodes
```
